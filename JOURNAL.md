## 10/6/2025 - Completed the Schematic  

## Day-1
### Completed the Schematic

Today I completed the schematic for my PassKey (PicoKey by name). I have chosen RP2354 chip as it has a better security option with internally stacked 2MB Flash. I have decided to make it as small as possible while being pocket friendly.

### Time Spent: 1h
