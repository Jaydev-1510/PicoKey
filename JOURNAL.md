This is my journal of the design and building process of **PicoKey**.

## 10/6/2025 - Completed the Schematic  

## Day-1
### Completed the Schematic

Today I completed the schematic for my PassKey (PicoKey by name). I have chosen RP2354 chip as it has a better security option with internally stacked 2MB Flash. I have decided to make it as small as possible while being pocket friendly.

### Time Spent: 1h

## 10/7/2025 - Routed the PCB  

## Day-2
### Completed Routing

It was very tough to make it on a very small PCB. I have managed to achieve a very tiny size of 12mm * 30mm while using cheap and basic components. I have chosen basic components which were available and are 0402 in size. I had started routing yesterday and completed it today. I had to do trial and error so as too achieve a very compact size. Now, I'll complete the BOM and other stuff, and then finally ship it.ðŸš¢

### Time Spent: 3.5h

## 10/10/2025 - Made changes  

## Day-3

### Made changes

I had uploaded the Gerber and the BOM in order to get the generate the quotation for PCB fabrication. I got to know that that the LED I had chosen was not in stock so I changed it and its resistor. Here is the final cost of PCB fabrication which is about $42.5

## 10/16/2025 - Add README.md + schematic  

## Day-4
### Add README.md + schematic
I added more content to the README.md about this project as suggested by @CAN. Also, the schematic image is not shown in the blueprint journal so I have added it here again. This is the schematic-
